# Installing Pact on Linux

To set up Pact on Linux, you'll need to download the binary and configure your system path. Follow the steps below to get Pact up and running on your Linux machine.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Pact, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

### Z3

Install Z3, which is required by Pact:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install z3
```

Verify Z3 installation:

```bash
z3 --version
```

## Installation

### Step 1: Download the Binary

Download a pre-built binary from the [Pact Releases](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact/releases) page. Look for the latest release and download the appropriate `.tar.gz` file for Linux.

### Step 2: Extract the Binary

Extract the downloaded archive:

```bash
tar -xzf pact-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

Navigate to the extracted directory:

```bash
cd pact-<version>-linux-x86_64
```

### Step 3: Place Binary in System Path

Move the `pact` binary to a directory in your system PATH, or update your PATH variable. For example, add the directory to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="/path/to/pact-directory:$PATH"
```

To make this change permanent, add the above line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
# Add the line at the end of the file
export PATH="/path/to/pact-directory:$PATH"
# Save and exit
```

Reload the shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Note:** Replace `~/.bashrc` with `~/.zshrc` if you use Zsh.

### Step 4: Verify the Installation

Verify the installation by checking the Pact version or ensuring the binary is in your PATH:

```bash
pact --version
echo $PATH
```

Ensure that the output includes the path to your `pact` binary.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using Pact for smart contract development and testing. For detailed usage instructions, refer to the [Pact Documentation](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

### Check Dependencies

Ensure Z3 and Pact are correctly installed. Verify their versions with:

```bash
pact --version
```

### Consult GitHub Issues

Visit the [Pact GitHub Issues](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact/issues) page for common problems and solutions.
