### What is a Blockchain?

A **blockchain** is a **digital ledger** that records transactions in a *cryptographically secure* and *decentralized* way. **Decentralization** and **transparency** are two of the properties that make a blockchain valuable for many different applications, industries, and use cases. For example, transactions recorded in the blockchain are **public** and available for anyone to view, but the records can’t be altered and the participants in the transaction are protected by **cryptographic abstraction**.

#### Decentralization

One of the most important features of a blockchain network is that its computational resources are distributed across many individual computers. The individual computers—called **nodes**—run the blockchain software and communicate with each other as a *peer-to-peer (P2P) network*, with no central authority—no government, corporation, or institution—controlling it. Instead, every node participating in the blockchain network has a copy of the ledger and any changes to the ledger must be verified and agreed to by multiple parties before they are accepted.

Users typically interact with a blockchain by submitting **transaction requests**, for example, to change the owner of a file or to transfer funds from one account to another. On the Kadena network, the transaction requests are picked up and validated by computers that solve complex mathematical problems. The validated transactions are **gossiped** to other nodes on the network and if there's agreement—**consensus**—on the validity of the transactions, they are assembled into a block.

After they've been accepted, all transactions that make it into a block are publicly visible on the blockchain.

This method of adding new blocks to the blockchain is known as a **proof of work consensus model** and the computers used to perform this work are often referred to as **miners** because they earn rewards for the work they do and these rewards are passed on to the node operators.

Not all blockchains use proof of work and mining to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain, but this approach to creating new blocks has proven to be more **secure**, **reliable**, and **decentralized** than most other consensus models.

#### Why It's Called a Blockchain

**Blocks** contain transaction results and other information. This other information includes a reference to the previous block, its **parent block**. This reference uses a **cryptographic hash**—something like a digital fingerprint—to definitively link each new block to its parent block, forming a chain from one block to the next that cannot be altered after they've been added to the chain.

#### Cryptography Ensures Security and Privacy

Another important feature of a blockchain is its use of **cryptography** to ensure the integrity of transactions and protect the privacy of participants. Cryptography helps provide guarantees within the network that only **authorized parties** sign transactions and that messages can't be *injected*, *intercepted*, *modified*, or *redirected* to unintended recipients.

#### Consensus Models

The method that a blockchain uses to batch transactions into blocks and to select which node can submit a block to the chain is called the blockchain's **consensus model** or **consensus algorithm**. All consensus models are concerned with providing three essential properties: **safety**, **liveness**, and **fault tolerance**.

The most commonly-used consensus model is the **proof-of-work consensus model**. With the proof-of-work consensus model, the node that completes a computational problem first has the right to submit a block to the chain.

The Kadena proof-of-work consensus model is unique in its use of multiple chains to improve the scalability of its consensus model. This unique consensus model is defined in the **Chainweb protocol**. For more information about Chainweb, see **Chainweb, simplified**.

For a blockchain to be fault tolerant and provide a consistent view of state even if some nodes are compromised by malicious actors or unavailable because of network outages, some consensus models require at least **two-thirds** of the nodes to agree on state. This two-thirds majority ensures that the network is fault tolerant and can withstand some network participants behaving badly, regardless of whether the behavior is intentional or accidental.

#### Blockchain Economics

All blockchains require resources—**processors**, **memory**, **storage**, and **network bandwidth**—to perform operations. The computers that participate in the network—the nodes that produce blocks—provide these resources to blockchain users. The nodes create a distributed, decentralized network that serves the needs of a community of participants.

To support a community and make a blockchain sustainable, most blockchains require users to pay for the network resources they use in the form of **transaction fees**. The payment of transaction fees requires user identities to be associated with accounts that hold assets of some type. Blockchains typically use **tokens** to represent the value of assets in an account and network participants purchase tokens outside of the chain through an exchange. Network participants can then deposit the tokens in **online wallets** to enable them to pay for transactions.

#### Blockchain Governance

Some blockchains allow network participants to submit and vote on proposals that affect network operations or the blockchain community. By submitting and voting on proposals, the blockchain community can determine how the blockchain evolves in an essentially **democratic** way. **On-chain governance** is relatively rare, however, and to participate, a blockchain might require users to maintain a significant stake of tokens in an account or to be selected as a representative for other users.

#### Applications Running on a Blockchain

Applications that run on a blockchain—often referred to as **decentralized applications** or **dApps**—are typically web applications that are written using frontend frameworks but with backend **smart contracts** for changing the blockchain state.

A **smart contract** is a program that runs on a blockchain and executes transactions on behalf of users under specific conditions. Developers can write smart contracts to ensure that the outcome of programmatically-executed transactions is recorded and can't be tampered with. Typically, smart contracts don't allow you to access to any underlying blockchain functionality—such as the consensus, storage, or transaction layers. Instead, smart contracts enable you to write programs that take advantage of blockchain features without requiring you to know about the network infrastructure or node operations.

Overall, blockchains offer a way to securely and transparently track transactions without the need for **intermediaries**, like banks or governments, which can help reduce costs and increase trust in online transactions. Blockchain technology also has the potential to *revolutionize* a wide range of industries, including **finance**, **healthcare**, **supply chain management**, and more. By providing a secure and transparent way to record and verify transactions, blockchain has the potential to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and improve trust between parties.

<summary><strong>Why Build on a Blockchain?</strong></summary>

### Why Build on a Blockchain?

The modern internet grew from the simple idea that computers should be able to connect and send messages to each other. To achieve this goal, a lot of people dedicated time and resources to developing a common set of **protocols** for everyone to use. So, given this open history, why are industries, and the internet itself, evolving toward **blockchain technology**—the so-called **Web 3** of the future—when most blockchain networks require their own individual protocols and often can't communicate with computers that aren't part of their blockchain network?

One of the primary reasons for moving in the direction of Web 3 is that the internet allows computers to send messages between each other but makes no guarantees beyond attempting to route them to the proper destination. Messages—**packets of data**—can be lost in transmission, intercepted, manipulated, redirected, or otherwise compromised. There are no guarantees that the sender, receiver, or even the message itself haven't been tampered with, intentionally or unintentionally.

**Blockchain technology**—largely through the use of strong **cryptographic standards**—offers many of these guarantees about the origin and receipt of messages, ensuring the **authenticity** and **integrity** of data transmitted and protecting the **privacy** and **ownership** of network participants. These guarantees make blockchains an attractive platform for many types of applications. For example, properties like **decentralization**, **transparency**, **data integrity**, **privacy**, and **verifiable records** make blockchains well-suited to handle the following common use cases:

- **Decentralized and traditional financial and banking services**
- **Gaming, digital marketplaces, virtual assets, and non-fungible token (NFT) collections**
- **Logistics and supply chain management**
- **Healthcare and health data management, interoperability, and patient privacy**
- **Real estate transactions and legal services**
- **Energy, sustainability, and environmental conservation initiatives**
- **Voting, voter identification and governance**

As this list suggests, building an application to run on a blockchain can be particularly useful when **regulation**, **transparency**, and **accountability** are important. However, it's also important to note that not all applications can—or should—be built to run on a blockchain. Every blockchain is, in essence, a **resource-constrained environment**. There are inherent challenges in any distributed peer-to-peer network. A blockchain isn't the best place for performing operations that require a lot of **computational overhead** or that generate a lot of **network traffic activity**. In most cases, a blockchain isn't well-suited for storing large amounts of **static or dynamic data**. Often, applications can incorporate a blockchain as part of a solution that performs some operations **off-chain** before submitting the results to be stored on-chain.

If you're interested in designing applications for a blockchain, you should consider what the blockchain does best and structure applications to take advantage of its guarantees but minimize the amount of computational overhead of the operations performed on-chain. If you keep in mind that a blockchain is primarily a **digital ledger** that records state changes, you'll be well-positioned to build applications that take advantage of the most essential blockchain properties.
