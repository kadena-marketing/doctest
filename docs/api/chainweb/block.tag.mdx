import CustomDocCardList from '@site/src/components/CustomDocCard';

These endpoints return whole blocks, headers and payloads, from the chain
database.

Generally, blocks are returned in ascending order and include orphaned
blocks.

For only querying blocks that are included in the winning branch of the
chain the `branch` endpoints can be used, which return blocks in descending
order starting from the leafs of branches of the block chain.

Blocks are returned in only one format, with block headers and payloads in
JSON encoding.
