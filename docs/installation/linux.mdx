# Installing Pact on Linux

To set up Pact on Linux, you'll need to download the binary and configure your system path. Follow the steps below to get Pact up and running on your Linux machine.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Pact, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="z3" label="Z3" default>
    Install Z3, which is required by Pact:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install z3
    ```

    Verify Z3 installation:

    ```bash
    z3 --version
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Installation Steps

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="binary" label="Download Binary" default>
    <Step stepNumber="1" title="Download the Binary">
      Download a pre-built binary from the [Pact Releases](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact/releases) page. Look for the latest release and download the appropriate `.tar.gz` file for Linux.

    </Step>

    <Step stepNumber="2" title="Extract the Binary">
      Extract the downloaded archive:

      ```bash
      tar -xzf pact-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
      ```

      Navigate to the extracted directory:

      ```bash
      cd pact-<version>-linux-x86_64
      ```
    </Step>

    <Step stepNumber="3" title="Place Binary in System Path">
      Move the `pact` binary to a directory in your system PATH, or update your PATH variable. For example, add the directory to your PATH:

      ```bash
      export PATH="/path/to/pact-directory:$PATH"
      ```

      To make this change permanent, add the above line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:

      ```bash
      nano ~/.bashrc
      # Add the line at the end of the file
      export PATH="/path/to/pact-directory:$PATH"
      # Save and exit
      ```

      Reload the shell configuration:

      ```bash
      source ~/.bashrc
      ```

      **Note:** Replace `~/.bashrc` with `~/.zshrc` if you use Zsh.

    </Step>

    <Step stepNumber="4" title="Verify the Installation">
      Verify the installation by checking the Pact version or ensuring the binary is in your PATH:

      ```bash
      pact --version
      echo $PATH
      ```

      Ensure that the output includes the path to your `pact` binary.
    </Step>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="dependencies" label="Check Dependencies" default>
    Ensure Z3 and Pact are correctly installed. Verify their versions with:

    ```bash
    pact --version
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="github" label="Consult GitHub Issues">
    Visit the [Pact GitHub Issues](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact/issues) page for common problems and solutions.
