# Why Kadena?

The philosophy at the heart of the Kadena network is based on the belief that **blockchain technology** can revolutionize how people communicate and interact with one another, that transactions can be handled safely and securely without a centralized authority, and that **transparency** and **privacy** aren't mutually exclusive.

## A New Approach to Blockchain Challenges

For blockchain technology to reach its full potential and be ready for global adoption, it needs to be **secure** and **scalable** enough for both individuals and businesses to depend on. With these challenges in mind, the Kadena founders envisioned and built a new chain architecture that leverages the best security and decentralization properties of **proof-of-work (PoW)** consensus and a unique **multi-chain** approach to scalability.

  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Complete Decentralized Infrastructure</strong></td>
      <td>The Kadena platform provides a completely decentralized infrastructure of nodes and tools for teams to launch products without having to build from scratch.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Safer Smart Contracts</strong></td>
      <td>The **Pact** smart contract programming language is designed to help you write safer smart contracts that are human-readable and error-free. By automatically detecting bugs, Pact helps you avoid writing contracts that are vulnerable to exploits that are common—and costly—on other platforms.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Write the Future on Pact</strong></td>
      <td>Pact is the first truly human-readable smart contract language. It lets anyone write clearly, directly, and safely onto a blockchain—a true advance for automated contracts. Pact automatically detects bugs and keeps the purpose of code clear. With other contract languages, finding bugs and making sense of fine print can be nearly impossible. Pact’s **Formal Verification** lets you test your contracts to make sure they do what’s intended. Additionally, when you reference code from other contracts, you stay in control of what happens with your transactions, even if they change their code.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Industrial Scalability</strong></td>
      <td>Unlike other platforms, Kadena is designed to power global financial systems. Our protocol continually scales to higher **TPS** (**Transactions Per Second**) as more chains are added to the network. With its revolutionary multi-chain architecture, Kadena is the only scalable layer-1 **Proof of Work (PoW)** platform capable of scaling to settle the 9+ million trades executed on the NYSE each day.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Proven Security</strong></td>
      <td>Our founders' experience at JPMorgan revealed the potential for – and limitations of – existing blockchain solutions. To solve for the security and throughput demands of financial services clients, Kadena’s protocol runs on the **Proof of Work (PoW)** consensus mechanism found in Bitcoin, rather than **Proof of Stake (PoS)**. To achieve Kadena’s breakthrough scalability, we braid together multiple Bitcoin-like chains, improving both throughput and scalability while maintaining the security and integrity found in Bitcoin.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>No-Cost Transactions</strong></td>
      <td>While we offer marginal transaction fees for consumers, we’ve gone a step further by introducing the first **Crypto Gas Stations** to allow businesses to eliminate all transaction fees for their customers, thus removing a key barrier to mass adoption of **dApps**.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>The Ideal Ecosystem</strong></td>
      <td>Kadena works with your preferred services, so you can build how you want and where you want. Empowered with our ecosystem of product and service integrations across enterprises, **mining**, **DeFi**, **oracles**, **interoperability**, **smart contracts**, **wallets**, and **exchanges**, our passionate community of builders, miners, and partners is changing how the world interacts and transacts.</td>
