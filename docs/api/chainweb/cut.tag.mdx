A cut represents a distributed state of a chainweb. It references one
block header for each chain, such that those blocks are pairwise
concurrent.

Two blocks from two different chains are said to be concurrent if either
one of them is an adjacent parent (is a direct dependency) of the other or
if the blocks do not depend at all on each other.
