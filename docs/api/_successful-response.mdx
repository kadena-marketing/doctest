#### Successful response schema

If the request is successful, the response returns `application/json` content with the following information:

| Parameter | Type | Description
| --------- | ---- | -----------
| items&nbsp;(required) | Array&nbsp;of&nbsp;strings | Lists the block hashes matching the request criteria. Each block hash string consists of 43 characters from the [`a-zA-Z0-9_-`] character set.
| limit&nbsp;(required) | integer&nbsp;>=&nbsp;0 | Specifies the maximum number of items to include in the page of results. This number can be smaller but never larger than the number of requested items.
| next&nbsp;(required) | string&nbsp;or&nbsp;null | Returns a value that can be used to query the next page. You can use this value for the `next` parameter in a follow-up request. The format for this parameter consists of two parts. The first part of the string can be `inclusive`, `exclusive` or `null`. The second part is the value that calls the next page of results or `null` if there are no more results to query.
