id: p2p-api

The **peer-to-peer (P2P) API** contains the RPC endpoints that Chainweb nodes must expose to establish blockchain consensus. 
These endpoints enable nodes to communicate about transactions waiting in the transaction pool and the blocks being produced. 
Although the peer-to-peer endpoints are intended primarily for communication between Chainweb nodes, they are also useful in providing low level insight into network operations, the progress of the blockchain, and node health.
Peer-to-peer endpoints are typically more efficient than similar service API endpoints for most use cases.

Each computer running `chainweb-node` serves peer-to-peer endpoints using the secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) on a network interface and port that is available directly on the public internet.

You can also make P2P API endpoints available for other clients by exposing the endpoints using reverse proxies, load balancers, authentication frameworks, or similar web technologies.

## Key features and use cases

The Chainweb API is essential for various blockchain operations and analysis:

1. **Node Information**: Access detailed information about individual nodes in the network.
2. **Block and Transaction Data**: Retrieve comprehensive data about blocks and transactions across Kadena's multi-chain architecture.
3. **Network Statistics**: Gather real-time statistics about the Kadena network's performance and state.
4. **Peer-to-Peer Network Interaction**: Manage and monitor connections between nodes in the Kadena network.
5. **Chain-Specific Queries**: Perform targeted queries on specific chains within Kadena's parallel chain structure.
6. **Mining Operations**: Access endpoints relevant for miners and mining pool operators.

These features make the Chainweb API invaluable for developers building infrastructure tools, block explorers, analytics platforms, and other applications requiring deep blockchain data access.

Each section provides detailed documentation, including endpoint descriptions, parameter explanations, and example requests and responses. Whether you're 
developing blockchain analytics tools, managing nodes, or building advanced dApps, these resources will guide you through effectively utilizing the Chainweb API.

## Getting started

To begin using the Chainweb API:

1. Familiarize yourself with Kadena's multi-chain architecture and consensus mechanism.
2. Set up a Kadena node or connect to an existing node to access the API.
3. Explore the documentation sections below to understand each API functionality.
4. Start with basic queries to retrieve blockchain data before moving to more complex operations.

Remember, the Chainweb API provides direct access to core blockchain data and operations. Always ensure you understand the implications of your API calls, 
especially when interacting with live network data.

## Endpoints

The Chainweb peer-to-peer API includes endpoints to return information about the following aspects of the peer-to-peer network:

- Distributed state using [`cut` endpoints](/api/peer-to-peer/get-cut)
- Raw block payload using [`payload` endpoints](/api/peer-to-peer/get-payload)
- Pending transaction using [`mempool` endpoints](/api/peer-to-peer/all-pending-mempool)
- Peer-to-peer connections using [`peer` endpoints](/api/peer-to-peer/cut-peer)
- Node configuration using the [`config` endpoint](/api/peer-to-peer/config)

For peer-to-peer connections, Chainweb nodes have two separate communication channels with specialized independent peer-to-peer networks that different nodes can be part of:

- The `/peer/cut` peer-to-peer network is responsible for communicating the consensus state across the distributed network nodes. 
- The `/peer/mempool` peer-to-peer network is responsible for queuing and managing the pending transactions for each chain independently. 

## Base URL

The base URL for peer-to-peer API endpoints typically take the form of `<hostname>/chainweb/0.0/mainnet01` where the `<hostname>` is the IP address or domain name of a Chainweb node in the Kadena public blockchain network. 
Similarly, the base URL for peer-to-peer endpoints in the Kadena test network is typically `<hostname>/chainweb/0.0/testnet04` where the `<hostname>` is the IP address or domain name of a Chainweb node in the Kadena test network.
If you're running a local development environment, you can typically replace `<hostname>` with `localhost:8080` to connect to the API and specify `development` as the network name.
