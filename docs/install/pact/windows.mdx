# Installing Pact on Windows with WSL

To install Pact on Windows, you'll need to set up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and use a Linux environment to install Pact. Follow these steps to get Pact up and running on your Windows machine.

## Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

### Enable WSL

- Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following command to enable WSL and install the default Linux distribution:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

- If the command does not automatically install Ubuntu, you can manually install it from the Microsoft Store.

### Restart Your Computer

- Restart your computer to complete the WSL installation.

### Install Ubuntu (Recommended)

- Open the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH4QHMC) and search for "Ubuntu".
- Select the latest Ubuntu version (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) and click "Install".

### Set Up Ubuntu

- After installation, open Ubuntu from the Start menu and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup, including creating a user account.

**Quick Tip:** For detailed WSL installation instructions and troubleshooting, use [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

## Prerequisites

Once WSL is set up with Ubuntu, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed within your Ubuntu environment:

### Z3

Install Z3, which is required by Pact:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install z3
```

Verify Z3 installation:

```bash
z3 --version
```

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download the Binary

Download a pre-built binary from the [Pact Releases](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact/releases) page. Look for the latest release and download the appropriate `.tar.gz` file for Linux.

### Step 2: Extract the Binary

     Extract the downloaded archive:

     ```bash
     tar -xzf pact-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
     ```

     Navigate to the extracted directory:

     ```bash
     cd pact-<version>-linux-x86_64
     ```
### Step 3: Place Binary in System Path

     Move the `pact` binary to a directory in your system PATH, or update your PATH variable. For example, add the directory to your PATH:

     ```bash
     export PATH="/path/to/pact-directory:$PATH"
     ```

     To make this change permanent, add the above line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:

     ```bash
     nano ~/.bashrc
     # Add the line at the end of the file
     export PATH="/path/to/pact-directory:$PATH"
     # Save and exit
     ```

     Reload the shell configuration:

     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

     **Note:** Replace `~/.bashrc` with `~/.zshrc` if you use Zsh.

### Step 4: Verify the Installation

Verify the installation by checking the Pact version or ensuring the binary is in your PATH:

```bash
pact --version
echo $PATH
```

Ensure that the output includes the path to your `pact` binary.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using Pact for smart contract development and testing. For detailed usage instructions, refer to the [Pact Documentation](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

### Check Dependencies

Ensure Z3 and Pact are correctly installed. Verify their versions with:

```bash
z3 --version
pact --version
```

### Consult GitHub Issues

Visit the [Pact GitHub Issues](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact/issues) page for common problems and solutions.
