# Installing Pact on Windows with WSL

To install Pact on Windows, you'll need to set up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and use a Linux environment to install Pact. Follow these steps to get Pact up and running on your Windows machine.

## Step 1: Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

1. **Enable WSL**
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following command to enable WSL and install the default Linux distribution:

     ```powershell
     wsl --install
     ```

   - If the command does not automatically install Ubuntu, you can manually install it from the Microsoft Store.

2. **Restart Your Computer**
   - Restart your computer to complete the WSL installation.

3. **Install Ubuntu (Recommended)**
   - Open the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH4QHMC) and search for "Ubuntu".
   - Select the latest Ubuntu version (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) and click "Install".

4. **Set Up Ubuntu**
   - After installation, open Ubuntu from the Start menu and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup, including creating a user account.

   **Quick Tip:** For detailed WSL installation instructions and troubleshooting, use [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

## Prerequisites

Once WSL is set up with Ubuntu, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed within your Ubuntu environment:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="z3" label="Z3" default>
    Install Z3, which is required by Pact:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install z3
    ```

    Verify Z3 installation:

    ```bash
    z3 --version
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Installation Steps

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="binary" label="Download Binary" default>
    <Step stepNumber="1" title="Download the Binary">
      Download a pre-built binary from the [Pact Releases](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact/releases) page. Look for the latest release and download the appropriate `.tar.gz` file for Linux.

    </Step>

    <Step stepNumber="2" title="Extract the Binary">
      Extract the downloaded archive:

      ```bash
      tar -xzf pact-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
      ```

      Navigate to the extracted directory:

      ```bash
      cd pact-<version>-linux-x86_64
      ```
    </Step>

    <Step stepNumber="3" title="Place Binary in System Path">
      Move the `pact` binary to a directory in your system PATH, or update your PATH variable. For example, add the directory to your PATH:

      ```bash
      export PATH="/path/to/pact-directory:$PATH"
      ```

      To make this change permanent, add the above line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:

      ```bash
      nano ~/.bashrc
      # Add the line at the end of the file
      export PATH="/path/to/pact-directory:$PATH"
      # Save and exit
      ```

      Reload the shell configuration:

      ```bash
      source ~/.bashrc
      ```

      **Note:** Replace `~/.bashrc` with `~/.zshrc` if you use Zsh.

    </Step>

    <Step stepNumber="4" title="Verify the Installation">
      Verify the installation by checking the Pact version or ensuring the binary is in your PATH:

      ```bash
      pact --version
      echo $PATH
      ```

      Ensure that the output includes the path to your `pact` binary.
    </Step>

Once installed, you can start using Pact for smart contract development and testing. For detailed usage instructions, refer to the [Pact Documentation](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="dependencies" label="Check Dependencies" default>
    Ensure Z3 and Pact are correctly installed. Verify their versions with:

    ```bash
    z3 --version
    pact --version
    ```
