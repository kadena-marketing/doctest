# How to Install Kadena Devnet

Setting up Kadena Devnet on your local machine allows you to develop and test your applications in a simulated environment before deploying them to the live Kadena network. Follow these steps to install Kadena Devnet using the official GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following tools installed:

  <TabItem value="jdk" label="Java Development Kit (JDK)" default>
    Install JDK version 11 or later from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="git" label="Git">
    Install Git for cloning the repository from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/).
  </TabItem>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Steps to Install Kadena Devnet

<Step stepNumber="1" title="Clone the Repository">
  Begin by cloning the Kadena Devnet repository from GitHub. Open a terminal and run:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/kadena-io/devnet.git
  cd devnet
  ```

  This clones the repository and changes your current directory to the newly created `devnet` folder.
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="2" title="Build the Project">
  The Devnet project uses Maven for building. Run the following command to compile and install the project:

  ```bash
  mvn clean install
  ```

  This command will download the required dependencies and build the project.
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="3" title="Configure Devnet">
  Create a configuration file for Devnet. Start by copying the example configuration file:

  ```bash
  cp src/main/resources/devnet.conf.example src/main/resources/devnet.conf
  ```

  Edit `devnet.conf` to adjust the settings according to your environment.
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="4" title="Run Devnet">
  To start the Devnet server, use the following Maven command:

  ```bash
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.kadena.devnet.Devnet"
  ```

  You should see logs indicating that Devnet is starting up.
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="5" title="Access Devnet">
  Once Devnet is running, you can interact with it through its HTTP API. By default, Devnet is available at:

  - API Endpoint: ``http://localhost:8080``

  Use this endpoint to develop and test your decentralized applications (dApps).
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="6" title="Docker (Optional)">
  If you prefer using Docker, you can build and run Devnet in a container. Ensure Docker is installed, then build the Docker image:

  ```bash
  docker build -t kadena-devnet .
  ```

  Run the Docker container:

  ```bash
  docker run -p 8080:8080 kadena-devnet
  ```
</Step>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation or usage:

    docker --version  # if using Docker
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="config" label="Configuration">
    Verify that the `devnet.conf` configuration file is correctly set up. Double-check the settings against the example file.
  </TabItem>
