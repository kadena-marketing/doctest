title: Service API endpoints
id: service-api

The Chainweb service API includes endpoints that expose functionality of the Chainweb node to clients other than computers running the `chainweb-node` software.
For example, other clients might include mining pools, decentralized services, web applications, exchanges, wallets, and so on.

If you're a node operator, you can enable service API endpoints using configuration settings for the Chainweb node. 
The endpoints are served on a separate port over the unencrypted Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). 
As a node operator, you can also choose to expose the endpoints locally or through reverse proxies, load balancers, authentication frameworks, and other similar web technologies.

### Endpoints

The Chainweb service API includes the following endpoints:

- [Block service endpoints](/reference/chainweb-api/service-block)
- [Block hash endpoints](/reference/chainweb-api/blockhash)
- [Block header endpoints](/reference/chainweb-api/blockheader)
- [Mining service endpoints](/reference/chainweb-api/mining)
- [Pact REST API endpoints](/reference/rest-api)
- [Rosetta endpoints](/reference/chainweb-api/rosetta)
- [Maintenance and other services endpoints](/reference/chainweb-api/misc)

### Base URL

Because the service API is configurable for individual nodes, the base URL for service API endpoints can vary.
For bootstrap nodes, service API endpoints typically take the form of `api.<hostname>/chainweb/0.0/mainnet01` where the `<hostname>` is the IP address or domain name of a Chainweb node in the Kadena public blockchain network. 
Similarly, the base URL for service API endpoints in the Kadena test network is typically `api.testnet.<hostname>/chainweb/0.0/testnet04` where the `<hostname>` is the IP address or domain name of a Chainweb node in the Kadena test network.
If you're running a local development environment, you can typically replace `<hostname>` with `localhost:8080` to connect to the API and, if necessary, specify `development` as the network name.

Note that the Pact endpoints for any given chain identifier use the route prefix `/chain/{chainId}/pact/` in addition to the base URL.
For more information about Pact endpoints, see the [Pact REST API](/reference/rest-api) or the [Pact OpenAPI](https://api.chainweb.com/openapi/pact.html) specification.

### Resource consumption and vulnerability

Some service API endpoints can require considerable resources on the server side,
Service API endpoints are also more vulnerable to denial-of-service (DOS) attacks.
In most cases, you should avoid exposing service endpoints to the public internet and use firewall rules or access controls to prevent unauthorized access.
