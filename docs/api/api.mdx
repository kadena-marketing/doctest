# Kadena APIs: Pact and Chainweb

Kadena offers two primary APIs to interact with its blockchain ecosystem: the Pact API and the Chainweb API. Each serves a distinct purpose in enabling developers to build and interact with the Kadena network.

## Pact API

The Pact API is your gateway to interacting with smart contracts on the Kadena blockchain. It allows you to:

- Execute smart contract functions
- Query contract state
- Submit transactions to the blockchain
- Interact with the Pact interpreter for testing and development

Pact API is essential for developers building decentralized applications (dApps) and working directly with smart contracts.

## Chainweb API

The Chainweb API provides lower-level access to the Kadena blockchain network. It focuses on node-level operations and blockchain data retrieval, enabling you to:

- Query block and transaction information
- Retrieve network stats and node status
- Interact with the peer-to-peer network
- Access chain-specific data in Kadena's multi-chain architecture

Chainweb API is crucial for developers working on infrastructure, block explorers, or requiring detailed blockchain data.
