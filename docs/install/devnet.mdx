# Set up Kadena Devnet

This guide will walk you through setting up a local Kadena development network (devnet) using Docker. You'll learn how to:

- Install the necessary prerequisites
- Set up and run the Kadena devnet
- Access the block explorer

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- A web browser

## Set up the local development network

Follow these steps to set up and run the Kadena devnet on your local machine:

1. Open a terminal on your computer.

2. Create a new Docker volume by running the following command:

   ```shell
   docker volume create kadena_devnet
   ```

3. Pull the `kadena_devnet` image and start the `devnet` container:

   ```shell
   docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -v kadena_devnet:/data --name devnet kadena/devnet
   ```

   This command does the following:
   - `--rm`: Automatically remove the container when it exits
   - `-it`: Run the container interactively with a pseudo-TTY
   - `-p 8080:8080`: Map port 8080 from the container to your local machine
   - `-v kadena_devnet:/data`: Mount the `kadena_devnet` volume to `/data` in the container
   - `--name devnet`: Name the container "devnet"
   - `kadena/devnet`: Use the official Kadena devnet Docker image

4. Wait for the image to download and the container to start. You'll see output in your terminal showing the devnet processes starting up.

## View the development network

The `devnet` container includes a block explorer that connects to the network. You can use this to view blocks as they're added to the blockchain and the transactions within them.

To access the block explorer:

1. Open a web browser on your local computer.
2. Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/explorer/](http://localhost:8080/explorer/).

You should now see the Kadena development network block explorer. Notice that blocks are added every five seconds, which is faster than the 30-second block time on the Kadena main network. This optimized block time helps streamline the development workflow.

## Next steps

Now that you have your Kadena devnet running, you're ready to start developing and testing your blockchain applications. Here are some suggested next steps:

- Create a wallet and fund it with test tokens
- Deploy a simple smart contract
- Interact with your deployed contract using the devnet

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the devnet:

  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker Issues" default>
    Ensure Docker is running correctly on your system:
    ```shell
    docker --version
    docker info
    ```
    If you see any errors, consult the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/#troubleshoot-the-daemon) for troubleshooting steps.

  <TabItem value="network" label="Network Issues">
    If you can't access the block explorer, check if the container is running and the port is correctly mapped:
    ```shell
    docker ps
    ```
    You should see the `devnet` container listed with port 8080 mapped.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="explorer" label="Explorer Not Loading">
    If the explorer doesn't load, try accessing the API directly:
    ```
    http://localhost:8080/chainweb/0.0/devnet/chain/0/block
    ```
    If this works, the issue might be with your browser. Try clearing your cache or using a different browser.
