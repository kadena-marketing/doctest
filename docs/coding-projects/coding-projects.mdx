# Coding projects

The **Coding projects** content area provides instructional material for working with the sample projects located in the `pact-coding-projects` repository.
The topics that correspond with the sample projects illustrate concepts in action and complement explanation topics with hands-on exercises and coding challenges. 
The projects themselves highlight common use cases that can be adapted to many scenarios or extended to address new use cases.

The `pact-coding-projects` repository includes the following sample projects for you to use as learning tools and basic how-to guides:

- Simple payment transfer (working with accounts and balances)
- Rotatable wallet (rotating keys and row guards)
- Contract dependencies (calling functions in one module from another module)
- Loan (working with multiple tables, manipulating data in tables)
- API requests (using a local server, formatting API requests)
