# Installing Pact on macOS

Setting up Pact on macOS can be done through Homebrew for a streamlined installation or by downloading the binary manually. Follow the instructions below for each method.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Pact, ensure you have the following tools installed:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="brew" label="Homebrew" default>
    Install Homebrew for package management if you haven't already:

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

    Verify Homebrew installation:

    ```bash
    brew --version
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="z3" label="Z3">
    Install Z3, which is required by Pact:

    ```bash
    brew install z3
    ```

    Verify Z3 installation:

    ```bash
    z3 --version
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Installation Steps

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="brew" label="Install via Homebrew" default>
    <Step stepNumber="1" title="Install Pact with Homebrew">
      Use Homebrew to install Pact:

      ```bash
      brew tap kadena-io/tap
      brew install pact
      ```

      This will install Pact and handle all dependencies.
    </Step>

    <Step stepNumber="2" title="Verify Installation">
      To confirm Pact is installed correctly, run:

      ```bash
      pact --version
      ```

      You should see Pactâ€™s version information.
    </Step>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="binary" label="Download Binary">
    <Step stepNumber="1" title="Download the Binary">
      Download a pre-built binary from the [Pact Releases](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact/releases) page. Look for the latest release and download the appropriate `.tar.gz` file for macOS.

    </Step>

    <Step stepNumber="2" title="Extract the Binary">
      Extract the downloaded archive:

      ```bash
      tar -xzf pact-<version>-mac-x86_64.tar.gz
      ```

      Navigate to the extracted directory:

      ```bash
      cd pact-<version>-mac-x86_64
      ```
    </Step>

    <Step stepNumber="3" title="Place Binary in System Path">
      Move the `pact` binary to a directory in your system PATH, or update your PATH variable. For example, add the directory to your PATH:

      ```bash
      export PATH="/path/to/pact-directory:$PATH"
      ```

      To make this change permanent, add the above line to your `~/.zshrc` file (or `~/.bashrc` if using Bash):

      ```bash
      nano ~/.zshrc
      # Add the line at the end of the file
      export PATH="/path/to/pact-directory:$PATH"
      # Save and exit
      ```

      Reload the shell configuration:

      ```bash
      source ~/.zshrc
      ```

      **Note:** If you use Bash, replace `~/.zshrc` with `~/.bashrc`.

    </Step>

    <Step stepNumber="4" title="Verify the Installation">
      Verify the installation by checking the Pact version or ensuring the binary is in your PATH:

      ```bash
      pact --version
      echo $PATH
      ```

      Ensure that the output includes the path to your `pact` binary.
    </Step>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
