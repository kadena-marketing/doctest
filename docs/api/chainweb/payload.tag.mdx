import CustomDocCardList from '@site/src/components/CustomDocCard';

Raw literal Block Payloads in the form in which they are stored on the chain.
By default only the payload data is returned which is sufficient for validating
the blockchain Merkle Tree. It is also sufficient as input to Pact for
executing the Pact transactions of the block and recomputing the outputs.

It is also possible to query the transaction outputs along with the payload data.
