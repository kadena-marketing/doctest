These endpoints return block hashes from the chain database.

Generally, block hashes are returned in ascending order and include hashes
from orphaned blocks.

For only querying blocks that are included in the winning branch of the
chain the `branch` endpoint can be used, which returns blocks in descending
order starting from the leafs of branches of the block chain.
