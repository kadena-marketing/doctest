These endpoints return block headers from the chain database.

Similar to the block endpoints, block headers are generally returned in
ascending order and include headers of orphaned blocks.

For only querying block headers that are included in the winning branch of
the chain the `branch` endpoints can be used, which return block headers in
descending order starting from the leafs of branches of the block chain.

Block headers are returned in three different formats specified in the `accept` header of the request:
*   `application/json`, returns block headers in base64Url (without padding)
    encoded binary.
*   `application/json;blockheader-encoding=object`, returns block headers in
    JSON encoding.
*   `application/octet-stream`, when supported by the endpoint, returns block
    headers as binary.
